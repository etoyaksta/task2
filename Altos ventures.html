                       <h2>Foxes and Hedgehogs</h2>
                       <div class="tags">Entrepreneurship / Efficiency / Management</div>
                       <div class="cont_text">
                           <p>“The fox knows many things; the hedgehog knows one big thing.”</p>&nbsp;
                           <p>– Archilochus, 8th century BC</p>
                           <p>For centuries, writers, poets and philosophers have pondered the dichotomy of the Fox and the Hedgehog. In a business context, we first read about these characters in the book “Good to Great.” According to its author, Jim Collins</p>
                           <p>“the fox is a cunning creature, able to devise a myriad of strategies for sneak attacks upon the hedgehog…Fast, sleek, beautiful, fleet of foot, and crafty – the fox looks like the sure winner. The hedgehog on the other hand, is a dowdier creature…He waddles along, going about his simple day, searching for lunch and taking care of his home…(but) despite the greater cunning of the fox, the hedgehog always wins.”</p>&nbsp;
                           <p>In our business, we’ve also thought about the Fox and the Hedgehog – and by observing them carefully, we’ve learned a few things. (The following comments may seem unconventional and a bit tongue in cheek, but based on real life characters in Silicon Valley).</p>
                           <p>Foxes tend to be serial entrepreneurs. Hedgehogs tend to stay at one company forever. (Some people must think that Hedgehogs are related to dinosaurs).</p>
                           <p>Foxes are very smart and quick on their feet. In meetings, if VCs try to nail them with tough questions, they will fire back great answers. Hedgehogs don’t like meetings (especially with VCs).</p>
                           <p>Foxes are well connected and excel at various games played in Silicon Valley and on Sand Hill Road. Naturally, Foxes are great at raising capital – they thrive in bubble markets. Hedgehogs would rather bootstrap – they do far better during the inevitable crashes.</p>

                           <div class="hide" id="mytext">
                               <p>Foxes are very social. They can be found hobnobbing with VCs at cocktail parties. Hedgehogs are too busy (or too preoccupied) to attend. If you introduce a Hedgehog to someone – for a “networking opportunity” – he might give you a funny look. If he can’t figure out how it’s relevant, he will politely blow you off.</p>
                               <p>The technology business is a surfing game – you have to be ready to roll off one wave to catch the next. So maybe the nimble Fox finally has the upper hand in Silicon Valley? But those Hedgehogs are surprisingly resourceful. They are naturally curious about everything and anything related to their pursuits. They like to tinker, experiment, and learn, and if changes are required, they can snap to action in a nanosecond.</p>
                               <p>We do acknowledge that even Hedgehogs don’t always win (even though they do so in the fable). Hedgehogs can be roadkill along many dusty, windy, pothole-filled roads. There are plenty of successful Foxes also (although</p>
                               <p>, the leadership guru, observed that most turn out to be dilettantes in the long run).</p>
                               <p>Great confusion can be created at times because, once in a while, a Fox may turn into a Hedgehog. Lou Gerstner started out as a Harvard MBA and McKinsey consultant (a classic Fox profile). Then he said something “very surprising” happened along the way – he wrote that he “</p>
                               <p>.” Maybe he turned into a Hedgehog – or perhaps he just talked and acted like one for a while.</p>
                               <p>Like the conflicted, tormented Tolstoy, a Fox may believe in being a Hedgehog, but turning into one is really hard to do. As the Supremes sang, “you can’t hurry love.” You can’t fake it either. Likewise with Hedgehogs. They are the genuine article.</p>
